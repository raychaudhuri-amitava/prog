A cycle graph is one of Group Explorer's four <a href="rf-geterms.html#visualizers">visualizers</a>, all of which can appear either in <a href="rf-um-helpwindow.html">help windows</a>, <a href="rf-geterms.html#sheet">sheets</a>, or in their own windows. When they appear in their own windows, this is refered to as a &quot;large view,&quot; and you can read about it in general <a href="rf-um-largewindow.html">here</a>. This page concentrates specifically on the differences between a large view for cycle graphs, as compared to the other visualizers. </p><p align="center"><img src="img/illustration-cgwindow.jpg" width="420" height="352"></p><h2>Interface specifics</h2><h3>Magnification</h3><p>On the edit menu and on the toolbar for large windows viewing cycle graphs, you will find controls for Zoom in<img src="iconimg/zoomin.png" width="22" height="22"> and Zoom out<img src="iconimg/zoomout.png" width="22" height="22">. These controls simply change the magnification level at which you are viewing the cycle graph. For a very small cycle graph, you may want a large image, and zooming in is useful. For a very large cycle graph (and a not-so-large screen) you may find that zooming out is helpful. </p><!--<h3>Dragging an image copy</h3><p>If you click on the cycle graph and hold your mouse button down while dragging the mouse across the screen, you will drag a copy of the cycle graph image (as a pixmap). This can be useful for dropping it as an image into other applications, such as word processing or presentation programs. </p>--><h2>Related interfaces </h2><p>The  controls in the right side of the large window for cycle graphs are described in <a href="rf-um-subsetlistbox.html">the help page for subset controls</a>.</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable --><hr><p align="center"><strong>Quick help links:</strong><br>  <a href="index.html">Contents</a> | <a href="gs-index.html">Getting Started</a> | <a href="tu-index.html">Tutorials</a> | <a href="rf-um-index.html">User Manual</a> | <a href="rf-miscreference.html">Miscellaneous Reference</a><br> <a href="rf-geterms.html">GE terminology</a> | <a href="rf-um-helpwindow.html">Help on help</a></p></body><!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
