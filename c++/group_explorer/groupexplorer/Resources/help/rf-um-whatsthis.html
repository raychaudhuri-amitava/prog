This is the &quot;What's this?&quot; button. It allows you to ask &quot;What's this?&quot; about anything in that window. It is very useful for getting quick, short help on a specific button, image, or any type of control.</p><h2>How to use it</h2><p>Begin it by  clicking the &quot;What's this?&quot; button. Your mouse pointer will then have a question mark next to it, as shown in the icon <img src="iconimg/whatsthis.png" width="24" height="28">. This means that the next thing you click on will not work as if you had <em>really</em> clicked on it, but will instead describe itself to you, answering the question &quot;What's this?&quot;</p><p>For instance, if you click the &quot;What's this?&quot; button and then click another toolbar button, like Copy<img src="iconimg/editcopy.png" width="22" height="22">, the copy command will <em>not</em> be performed, but you will receive a quick balloon of help about the Copy command. Here is a screenshot of balloon help for the Partitions section of <a href="rf-um-subsetlistbox.html">the subset control</a>. </p><p align="center"><img src="img/illustration-whatsthis.jpg" width="474" height="395"></p><p>As you can see, these balloon help documents are short (in fact, this is one of the longer ones!) but they may contain links. Clicking such a link opens a real help document at the place described by the link.</p><p>For this reason, if you are confused about a particular control on a particular window, sometimes using &quot;What's this?&quot; help is the quickest, easiest way to go. It prevents you from searching through the whole <a href="rf-um-index.html">User Manual</a> for one small piece of information.</p><p>Not all windows in Group Explorer have &quot;What's this?&quot; functionality, but all the large ones do.</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable --><hr><p align="center"><strong>Quick help links:</strong><br>  <a href="index.html">Contents</a> | <a href="gs-index.html">Getting Started</a> | <a href="tu-index.html">Tutorials</a> | <a href="rf-um-index.html">User Manual</a> | <a href="rf-miscreference.html">Miscellaneous Reference</a><br> <a href="rf-geterms.html">GE terminology</a> | <a href="rf-um-helpwindow.html">Help on help</a></p></body><!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
