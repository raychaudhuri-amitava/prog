        <h3>Organize by subgroup</h3>
        <p>This control reorders the rows and columns of the table so that the subgroup
        you choose (and its cosets) form sections.  The subgroup will be at the left of
        the top row and the top of the left column; its cosets proceed across (and down)
        thereafter.</p>

        <h3>Separate cosets</h3>
        <p>If you have already organized by subgroups (the drop-down list control above
        the "separate cosets" slider) then this control becomes active and allows you to
        put a space between cosets, helping the viewer mentally separate them as well.
        The position of the slider governs how much space will be between cosets; when
        the slider is full left, no space, and more space as it moves to the right.</p>

        <p>These controls govern the zoom level of the three-dimensional image viewed

        controls.  They do not change the object, but only your view of it.</p>

        that nodes may be scaled for other reasons (e.g. if the diagram is too large to
        cram in all the nodes it must contain) but this slider determines the base size
        from which such alterations are performed.</p>

        "depth cueing."  The checkbox for fog turns it on and off, and the slider
        determines its intensity--left is less fog, right is more.</p>
