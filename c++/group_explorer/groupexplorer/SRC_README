There are three steps to building GE2 from source:


1. Install Qt 4.5 on your machine.  Probably the easiest
   way to do this is with the latest binary installer of
   the Qt SDK from www.qtsoftware.com.
   Or if you're on Linux, your distro may have a package
   with Qt 4.5 in it.


2. Get the Resources directory

In order to save space, I do not include that directory with
the sources, but you can get it from SourceForge.
It is necessary; it contains all the group data and help files.
It also comes in every install ation of GE on OS X or Windows.

Put the Resources directory in the same directory that holds the
src/ folder (i.e., they should be siblings in the directory tree
on your machine).


3. Compile

Follow the standard procedure for building Qt-based applications,
as follows.  From the directory containing GroupExplorer.pro
(should be the parent directory of the src/ and Resources/
directories), do these two steps:
    $ qmake -o Makefile GroupExplorer.pro  # this makes a Makefile
    $ make                                 # this does the build
