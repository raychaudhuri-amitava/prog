Linking Group Explorer statically or dynamically with other modules is
making a combined work based on Group Explorer.  Thus, the terms and
conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of Group
Explorer give you permission to combine Group Explorer program with free
software programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and
with code included in the standard release of the Qt Undo/Redo Framework
under its standard license (or modified versions of such code, with
unchanged license). You may copy and distribute such a system following
the terms of the GNU GPL for Group Explorer and the licenses of the other
code concerned, provided that you include the source code of that other
code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.

Note that people who make modified versions of Group Explorer are not
obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it
is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives
permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception.
